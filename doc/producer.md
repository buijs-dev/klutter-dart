In Klutter terminology a producer is a project for creating (producing) 
a plugin with Klutter.

A producer project is basically a Flutter plugin project with an extra 
Kotlin Multiplatform module where all (native) platform code will be written.

The following producer tasks are available:
- kradle create (create new klutter project)
- kradle init (initialize Klutter in an existing flutter project)
